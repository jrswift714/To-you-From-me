    <h1>Come and See</h1>
    <p id="stories">How insidious, this loneliness is</p>
    <p id="stories">By way of great terror should we look to the sky and see 5 fingers of darkness blotting out our once loved comrade that lit the land,</p>
    <p id="stories">Leaving a dark fog to confuse and perpetuate our fumbling meander to grasp one another.</p>
    <p id="stories">We mourn what we once had, the notion of what was lost to us drives our misery,</p>
    <p id="stories">Into deeper, darker pathways of winding torture.</p>
    <p id="stories">We look to the sky, and know it’s looking back, there to smirk at our wallowing and drink in the horror of our narrow experience.</p>
    <p id="stories">Some say it is our quintessential flaw, that we should look for hope when stark truth hovers in the ebony expanse of our once-great gods.</p>
    <p id="stories">‘Where are they?’ We’ve asked, ‘where are you?’</p>
    <p id="stories">We’ve scorned the deities long ago, the nail hammered to dust long ago, more pondering is useless since this long ago.</p>
    <p id="stories">As is the rest of it.</p>
    <p id="stories">In truth, there is no known ‘we’,</p>
    <p id="stories">In my rolling stumble across this desolate tundra, I am alone, but that cannot be possible, because I know that we did not   all   die.</p>
    <p id="stories">We could not have, for then what would the sky drink?</p>
    <p id="stories">So quell my panic with a slapdash argument that there must be others, and so we are a ‘we’ and not my only ‘I’.</p>
    <p id="stories">But maybe, I am I and we is dead, and so I could banish this sky by seeking to shred</p>
    <p id="stories">My fragile neck on the stark rocks that pockmark the shocks</p>
    <p id="stories">Of gray torture that is sure</p>
    <p id="stories">To not be here when I am gone</p>
    <p id="stories">Because I am all it has. And when I am gone, then it will starve.</p>
    <p id="stories">How insidious the sky must be. I am glad to bid it farewell.</p>
